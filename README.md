1. Use Public or Perish to crawl the top 500 Google Scholar keywords (literature/books) and output them as a CSV file

2. The CSV file was processed, including sorting by citations, splitting the authors of the literature and calculating the total number of citations of the authors and ranking them, and summarizing the top three papers with the highest number of citations by the authors, and filtering the authors according to the citations provided

3. Finally, the relationship between the authors who have co-published is expressed by undirected graphs, and the interdependence between these highly cited scholars in the published literature can be roughly obtained
